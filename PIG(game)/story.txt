Once upon a time, in a <adjective1> <place>, there was a <noun1> named <name>. 
This <noun1> loved to <verb1> every <time_of_day>. One day, <name> went to the <place2> 
to <verb2> some <plural_noun1>. There, <name> met a <adjective2> <noun2> who said, 
"<exclamation>! I have never seen such a <adjective3> <noun1> who could <verb1> like you!"
They became <adjective4> friends and went on <adjective5> adventures together, 
discovering <adjective6> <plural_noun2> and <verb3>ing <adjective7> <plural_noun3>. 
And they lived <adverb1> ever after.
